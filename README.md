# aufgabe-dog-api
##Code Challenge for Streamdiver:

##Build a nice looking Application that consumes https://dog.ceo/dog-api/. Goal is to show a paged list of pictures that can be filtered by breed (standard 10 pictures that can be changed to 25, 50 or infinite scrolling). During filtering there should be a nice and smooth animation to hide filtered out pictures. The User should be able to save pictures of dogs on mouseclick. On Endpoint /mydogs the saved pictures should be listed.
